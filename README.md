# Machine Learning for Hackathons
Machine Learning for Hackathons Workshop

In this workshop, we will be explaining the basics of Machine Learning and NLP and we will also be experimenting with 'straight out-of-the-box' functionalities of HuggingFace Transformers, without using any data, training, pre-training, or fine-tuning of any sorts. Finally, We will be explaining how ML Models can be deployed to a simple Web App using Streamlit.

**Prerequisites**: Basics of Python and Understanding of Juypter notebooks

**Techstack**: Transformers, Streamlit, Beautiful Soup, Requests, PyTorch and Tensorflow

**Keywords**: NLP, sentiment-analysis, Question-answering, GPT-2, HuggingFace
